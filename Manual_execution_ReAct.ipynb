Therefore, the pattern `text\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/html` should be corrected to `text\\\\/html`. The addition of `NF` (non-empty field) in the previous command was intended to address the `base64: invalid input` error and should be retained.

To diagnose this, the output of the `awk` command needs to be inspected directly before it is piped to `base64 -d`.
