üß† Thought generated for question 3: <your internal reasoning about what should be done next>
The previous attempt to extract and decode a base64 string failed, indicating either the specific function call `FromBase64String("")` was not present, or the regex used was too specific, or the content was not a standard base64 string within that context.

My next step will be to broaden the search for potential base64 encoded strings within the file. I will use `grep` to look for lines containing a sequence of characters commonly found in base64 strings, ensuring the character set is correct and the string length is reasonable, then attempt to decode any matches. This approach will be less dependent on specific PowerShell function calls and more focused on identifying the characteristic pattern of a base64 string itself.

üß† Thought generated for question 4: The user wants to find the SMTP port from a PowerShell script. I need to examine the contents of the target file, `Datasets/file_analysis_2/HDWallpaperEngine.txt`. PowerShell scripts often use specific commands or .NET objects for network communication like sending email (SMTP). I should search for keywords such as "SMTP", "port", "mail", "send", or "SmtpClient" within the file. The `grep` command is suitable for this purpose. I will start by searching for "SMTP" or "port" to quickly identify relevant lines.
