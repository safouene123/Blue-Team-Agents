üß† Thought generated for question 8 by tool 1: I need to find the URL of the company's logo within the .eml file. First, I should examine the email's contents. I can use `file` to understand the file type and confirm it's an email. Then, I can use `strings` to extract all strings from the file.  Since I'm looking for a URL, I'll look for any strings that look like a URL, starting with "http" or "https".  After extracting the strings, I can use `grep` to filter for lines containing "http" or "https" to narrow down the search. The results should reveal the URL.

üß† Thought generated for question 9 by tool 1: I need to analyze the .eml file to find URLs. I should start by examining the file to extract the URLs. Since the question mentions a Facebook profile URL, I should look for URLs that include "facebook.com". Once I've isolated a Facebook URL, I need to extract the username from it. Typically, Facebook profile URLs have the username at the end of the path, after a forward slash ("/"). I need to find the relevant URL and then isolate the username.
