üß† Thought generated for question 1: To identify the private IP address of the infected host, I need to list the IP addresses involved in the network traffic captured in the PCAP file. A good first step is to get a summary of all IP conversations. This will show which IP addresses are communicating with each other. By inspecting this list, I can look for an IP address that falls into the private (RFC 1918) address space (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16). This private IP is almost certainly the infected internal host. The `tshark` tool has a feature to display IP conversations, which is perfect for this purpose.

üß† Thought generated for question 3: I need to analyze the provided PCAP file to identify HTTP traffic. Specifically, I'm looking for HTTP GET requests where the requested URI path starts with `/images/`. Once I find these requests, I need to extract the `Host` header value, which corresponds to the domain name.

The `tshark` tool is the most suitable for this task because it can parse and filter HTTP protocol fields directly.

My plan is to use `tshark` with a display filter to isolate the relevant packets and then extract the `http.host` field. The display filter will combine two conditions: `http.request.method == "GET"` and `http.request.uri contains "/images/"`.
